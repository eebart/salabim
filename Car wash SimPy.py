# simulates a carwash; cars queue up at the entrance; each car chooses
# one of two grades of wash, MostlyClean (1.0 unit of time) and Gleaming
# (2.0 units of time); there is only one bay in the carwash, so only one
# is served at a time; at the exit there is a buffer space where cars
# wait to go out onto the street; cross traffic does not stop, so a car
# must wait for a large enough gap in the traffic in order to move out
# onto the street 

# usage:  

# python CarWash.py ArrRate PropMostlyClean BufSize CrossRate ExitTime MaxSimTime

# where:

#    ArrRate = rate of arrivals of calls to carwash (reciprocal of mean 
#              time between arrivals)
#    PropMostlyClean = proportion of cars that opt for the MostlyClean wash
#    BufSize = number of cars that can fit in the exit buffer
#    CrossRate = rate of arrivals of cars on the street passing the carwash
#    ExitTime = time needed for one car to get out onto the street
#    MaxSimtime = amount of time to simulate

# basic strategy of the simulation:  model the carwash itself as a
# Resource, and do the same for the buffer and the front spot in the
# buffer; when a car acquires the latter, it watches for a gap big
# enough to enter the street
